Over   the   sandbar   under   low - hanging   clouds   over   the   waters   you   skim ,   The   moon   of   the   borders   shines   coldly   and   you   her   company   gain .
The   heavenly   creature   once   gone   has   never   returned ,   For   thousands   of   years   white   clouds   have   in   the   skies   drifted   in   vain .
From   the   pavilion   one   sees   the   sun   setting   behind   the   mountains ,   Unrelentingly   towards   the   sea   the   Yellow   River   flows ;
I ' ve   been   back   to   stare   at   the   red   chamber ,   in   the   rain   cold   is   the   atmosphere   in   between ,   Alone   I   make   my   jolted   return   with   the   lamp   and   screen   beads   sway   alongside .
Who   in   the   history   of   the   Han   Palace   could   her   beauty   compare   with ?   Perhaps   only   the   lovely   lady   by   the   name   of   Dashing   Swallow   on   her   debut .
To   rise   above   on   a   cliff   to   watch   the   sun   emerge   from   the   sea ,   And   hear   heavenly   crows   in   the   open   sky   of   a   summit .
The   daunting   route   into   the   region   of   Shu   is   more   daunting   than   climbing   the   sky .
Peaks   short   of   touching   the   sky   by   a   mere   foot   join   to   form   mountain   ranges ,   And   off   abrupt   and   sheer   precipices   hang   withered   pines .
Ask   not   about   the   Liang   Mansion   and   company   of   old ,   For   I   have   been   frustrated   and   stricken   like   Xiangru   in   a   Maoling   storm .
Court   maids   remain   though   their   hair   has   turned   grey ,   Chatting   about   the   good   old   days   when   Emperor   Xuanzong   came   to   reside .
Soldiers   on   duty   would   gaze   at   the   sights   of   this   borderland ,   Though   they   hope   for   homecoming ,   bitter   are   most   of   their   faces ;
He   ventured   awkwardly   into   a   cave   that   was   deep   and   narrow ,   Which   led   to   an   open   plain   as   he   came   out   of   the   mountain   hollow .
The   moon   shone   through   pines   on   peaceful   cottages ,   The   sun   rose   through   clouds   amid   crowing   of   roosters   and   barking   of   dogs .
On   horses   and   their   mane   fall   snowflakes   that   soon   are   melted   by   sweat ,   And   turn   to   frost   once   the   horses   stop ,   regardless   if   they   are   thoroughbreds ,   even   the   inkwell   used   for   drafting   summonses   to   arms   have   become   frozen   inside   the   tent .
As   tides   ebb   away ,   apparent   are   weirs   in   shallowing   waters ,   The   Cove   of   the   Cloudy   Dream   appears   deeper   on   cold   days .
I   admire   the   sight   of   pines   after   the   rain ,   I   follow   the   waters   further   into   the   mountains   and   at   its   source   arrive .
There   are   flowers   by   the   brook   and   there   springs   spirituality ,   Words   fail   me   as   I   a   moment   of   enlightenment   find .
White   snow   drifts   between   clouds   and   fields   of   ochre ,   When   there   is   no   victory   to   the   emperor ' s   grace   repay ,   there   shan ' t   be   a   return .
Unfortunately   you   and   your   sister   had   to   grow   up   without   a   mother ,   With   as   much   tender   love   and   care   as   I   could   provide ,   you   were   raised .
Be   respectful   and   observe   your   duties   as   a   married   lady ,   Be   modest   and   traditions   follow   on   how   you   appearance   and   manners   maintain .
I   have   been   writing   letters   though   they   seldom   managed   to   destinations   reach ,   Besides ,   the   military   upheaval   has   not   yet   ceased   fire .
The   master   and   the   minister   have   had   their   meet ,   Ever   fonder   of   such   a   tree   people   have   grown   to   be .
The   clouds   above   unite   with   those   over   the   Magic   Gorge ,   The   chill   of   the   moon   corresponds   with   the   frosty   white   of   the   Snow   Mountain   range .
What   supports   them   is   no   less   than   the   miraculous ,   Allowing   them   to   grow   upright   and   tall   is   Nature ' s   divine   will .
Oh ,   have   a   rest ,   my   friend ,   and   give   me   a   turn   to   sing   you   a   bout ,   I   have   something   quite   different   to   sing   about .
Willow   catkins   scatter   in   the   wind   and   into   the   tavern   breezes   a   flowery   scent ,   A   charming   Wu   lady   calls   out   to   customers   to   taste   wine   just   fermented ;
Consider   this ,   my   friends ,   the   endlessly   eastbound   waters ,   And   parting   sorrow   in   comparison ,   which   persists   for   a   greater   length ?
One   day   whether   soon   or   late   on   your   return   through   the   towns   of   Ba ,   Do   write   a   letter   home   beforehand ;
I   care   not   how   far   I ' d   have   to   travel   to   receive   you   on   your   way ,   Even   if   I   have   to   go   all   the   way   to   Changfengsha .
Such   an   unexpected   encounter   seems   a   dream ,   it   has   me   in   disbelief ,   With   regret   we   mutually   enquired   how   each   have   been   in   the   past   and   in   the   present   day .
Thousands   of   square   miles   of   deep   snow   sparkled   with   freezing   reflection ,   The   flags   of   three   frontier   towns   flew   high   in   the   skies   in   the   first   light   of   dawn .
Over   in   the   Hun   skies   beacon   fires   of   battlefields   overshadowed   the   moon ,   The   Cloud   Mountains   and   the   seashore   of   Bo   held   their   own   to   the   Fort   of   Ji   support .
Although   as   a   youth   I   did   not   forsake   the   civil   office   for   the   military   like   Ban   Chao ,   I   could   still   sacrifice   my   life   as   exemplified   by   Zhong   Jun   and   be   courageous   and   bold .
Here   I   am   again   seeing   off   a   nobleman ,   Leaving   me   with   parting   sorrow   as   thick   as   this   field   is   with   grass   that   saturates .
I ' d   readily   buy   however   much   required   to   drink   to   our   hearts '   content .
Though   these   stone   drums   have   suffered   the   elements   of   weather   and   wild   fire ,   They   have   been   protected   and   looked   after   by   spirits   and   souls   sedulously .
My   friend ,   from   where   did   you   obtain   a   copy   of   these   inscriptions ?   The   script   appear   intact   and   without   smudges .
Some   strokes   seem   like   phoenixes   fluttering   in   the   wind   carrying   heavenly   gods ,   Or   like   green   coral   branches   with   sprigs   and   sprays   that   interlock .
Some   seem   to   have   the   strength   of   golden   strings   and   iron   wires ,   tightly   intertwined ,   Or   like   an   ancient   tripod   aplomb   in   the   water   over   which   a   dragon   shuttles .
They   should   be   consecrated   in   the   Great   Shrine   like   the   tripods   from   the   Gao   region ,   Their   worth   would   be   beyond   a   hundredfold   the   labour   and   tug .
The   drums   were   left   behind   for   shepherd   boys   to   fire   strike   and   bulls   their   horns   sharpen ,   Who   would   be   there   to   heritage   hold   on   to   and   culture   cultivate ?
Lumen   in   the   moonshine   is   a   picture   of   trees   and   their   shadows   amid   misty   waters ,   Inadvertently   I   come   to   where   Master   Pang   secluded   his   life ;
The   moon   never   learns   to   drink ,   My   shadow   absent - mindedly   follows   me .
After   Caizhou   was   quelled   and   the   head   rebel   caught   as   an   offering   to   the   Great   Shrine ,   Boundless   was   the   emperor ' s   grace   as   he   their   merit ,   reward   and   modesty   umpired .
Overwhelmed   with   joy   Han   Yu   kneeled   and   bowed   in   appreciation   and   said :   “ A   composition   for   a   stone   monument ,   that   I   am   able   to   provide   .
Shortly   after ,   the   weather   clears   up   and   many   peaks   appear ,   I   raise   my   head   to   admire   the   soaring   mountain   range   holding   up   a   blue   dome .
Whitewashed   walls   with   crimson   columns   stand   animated   and   glorious ,   Paintings   of   the   spiritual   are   full   of   colours   that   interlock .
In   the   tower   of   the   temple   I   take   up   my   lodging   for   the   night ,   The   moon   and   stars   are   enshrouded   by   clouds ,   and   their   shine   obscured .
I   turn   around   to   see   my   wife ,   who   is   no   longer   in   gloom ,   Mad   with   joy   she   is ,   casually   packing   up   books   and   scrolls .
Being   far   away   from   town ,   I   have   not   dishes   fit   of   a   feast ,   Being   poor ,   I   have   only   one   carafe   of   stale   brew   to   go   around .
Being   high   up   on   a   tower   brings   blossoms   close   grieving   the   heart   of   an   outsider ,   Amidst   the   various   sufferings   our   nation   is   in ,   here   I   am   making   a   climb .
Between   heaven   and   earth   spreads   spring   scenery   of   the   Brilliant   River ,   Forever   transforming   are   the   floating   clouds   of   the   mountain   ranges   of   Jadeite .
The   general   strokes   his   white   and   shiny   armour ,   He   could   feel   the   engraving   on   the   grip   of   his   treasured   sword .
Leaves   shaken   off   trees   by   autumn   aught   to   know   Song   Yu ' s   grief ,   Who   was   a   gallant   and   elegant   learned   man ,   a   fitting   model   for   me .
This   watch   tower   stands   in   the   cold   in   an   old   battlefield ,   Drifting   snow   brings   a   wash   of   white   to   the   gloom   of   the   Great   Desert .
A   lone   cloud   sends   off   a   flight   of   wild   cranes ,   How   could   the   temporal   be   the   place   for   them ?
Before   Han   Emperor   Wu ' s   Great   Spirit   Shrine   clouds   begin   to   thin ,   Down   below ,   rain   begins   to   clear   over   the   Peak   of   Heavenly   Palm .
I   wonder   aloud   to   travellers   on   the   road   seeking   wealth   and   fame ,   Why   not   stay   here   in   nature   and   life ' s   honest   aspiration   expand ?
Heartbroken   in   the   presence   of   freshly   brewed   wine ,   I   can   down   gallons   of   it   despite   its   price   to   nostalgia   efface .
Basked   in   royal   grace   they   stoutly   face   the   enemy   regardless   of   their   might ,   Even   though   it   is   not   enough   to   lift   the   siege ,   they   have   given   every   endeavour .
Visible   everywhere   is   blood   on   swords   and   glaives ,   If   they   are   willing   to   fight   to   their   end ,   how   could   it   be   for   rewards   and   fame ?
We   have   been   to   the   border   repeatedly   and   back ,   Where   there   are   reeds ,   yellowed   they   all   have .
At   dusk   and   at   dawn   come   northerlies ,   In   the   wind ,   evocative   of   sorrow   and   grief   is   the   singing   of   cicadas   that   breaks .
Deep   in   the   woods   where   no   one   would   takes   any   notice ,   There   is   only   the   moon   shining   on   my   solitude .
The   sun   rises   above   the   sea   out   of   the   remains   of   night ,   Gone   is   last   year   as   at   the   river   shores   arrives   springtime .
The   sails   were   brought   down   for   mooring   by   a   town   on   the   River   of   Huai ,   A   roadhouse   for   officers   stood   alone   by   the   dockside .
On   the   eve   of   his   departure   she   sewed   thread   after   thread ,   Worrying   that   his   return   would   be   delayed   and   late .
The   ladies   over   and   again   their   hair   comb   and   into   the   mirror   look ,   More   incense   burn   as   they   robes   change   to   keep   themselves   occupied .
So   far   in   the   distance   you   are ,   beyond   indistinct   mountains   and   remote   waters ,   South   of   the   Yangtze   where   grass   withers   not   in   autumn .
Over   rice   paddocks   fly   egrets   above   watery   fields ,   In   the   shade   of   summer   foliage   chirp   orioles   in   the   green .
The   Yellow   River   has   become   turbulent   with   billows   reaching   the   darkened   sky ,   At   the   wharf   boats   have   stopped   to   people   ferry .
You   were   not   engaged   when   we   went   our   separate   ways ,   You   are   now   married   with   children   after   all   this   time .
After   ten   years   of   separation   in   a   world   of   upheaval ,   As   grown   men   we   meet   again .
I ' m   married   to   a   Qutang   merchant ,   Time   and   again   he   failed   to   return   on   time .
In   a   desolate   court   full   of   loneliness   spring   was   coming   to   an   end ,   Behind   gates   tightly   shut   flowers   from   pear   trees   drifted   to   the   ground   everywhere .
One   day   when   it   is   time   to   retire   I   shall   return   here   to   build   a   cottage ,   So   as   to   Tao   Yuanming ' s   example   follow   and   live   with   a   contented   mind .
Who   would   a   figure   on   a   sandbar   in   the   river   notice ,   Who   is   already   nostalgic   and   seeing   blues   in   the   duckweed   floating   by ?
The   barely   discernible   Trident   Peaks   range   beyond   the   blue   skies ,   The   river   waters   part   into   two   waterways   that   around   the   Egret   Islet   roll .
She   is   confident   of   her   hands   and   fingers   to   fine   needlework   produce ,   She   is   not   obsessed   with   having   her   eyebrows   long   and   fine .
He   is   probably   tying   up   some   twigs   and   firewood   by   the   creek ,   To   return   and   a   decoction   make ,   to   stony   doctrines   follow   for   a   spiritual   life .
On   Day   Three   of   my   marriage   I   enter   the   kitchen ,   I   wash   my   hands   to   a   soup   prepare .
The   sun   cast   inclined   rays   on   the   Terrace   of   Spirits   in   view ,   The   redwoods   greeted   with   flowering   red   dabbled   in   morning   dews .
Who   can   this   army   lead   and   charge ,   And   surmount   the   Dragon   Town   in   one   strike ?
My   beauty   hindered   my   early   days ,   Now   I   would   come   to   the   mirror   only   to   feel   languid   to   make - up   apply .
A   fair   lady   of   unrivalled   beauty ,   Lived   in   a   remote   valley   away   from   society .
Moonlight   so   clear   and   pure   quietly   on   woods   and   waters   fell ,   Reflections   on   windows   and   curtains   sprightly   shined .
What   could   we   do   about   the   thousands   of   miles   between   you   and   me ?   I   only   hope   that   breezes   could   fragrances   of   orchid   and   azalea   diffuse   far   and   wide .
Take   this   winter   for   example ,   The   soldiers   out   west   don ' t   get   to   rest ,   they   have   been   deployed   to   another   battle   engage .
Few   come   this   way   to   this   forlorn   temple   see ,   For   it   is   shielded   by   clouds ,   mountain   peaks   and   a   deep   waterway .
I ' m   reminded   of   the   regretful   history   of   the   short - lived   southern   dynasties ,   Still   gushing   through   to   this   day   is   the   Yangtze   in   full   spate !
The   warmth   of   spring   is   readily   felt   tonight ,   Through   the   green   window   screen   insects   have   started   to   buzz   and   hum .
I   miss   my   children   from   a   distance ,   I ' ve   run   aground   in   Changan   yet   they   may   be   too   young   to   my   presence   pine .
Over   the   Cove   of   the   Cloudy   Dream   rises   vapour   and   mist ,   Vibrant   is   the   town   of   Yueyang   by   the   waters   that   undulates .
I   asked ,   “ what   brings   you   here   today ? ” You   said   you   came   to   buy   an   axe   so   as   to   a   clearing   make .
Karma   brought   you   to   China ,   On   your   way   here   it   was   like   wayfaring   a   dream .
In   the   tough   times   of   the   present   day ,   my   rapidly   greying   hair   adds   to   my   grievance ,   I   cannot   help   but   give   up   on   alcohol   as   I   have   become   so   indisposed ,   down   and   out .
I   passed   the   threshold   to   find   a   secluded   path   behind   green   bamboos ,   As   we   walked   along ,   our   clothes   brushed   pass   various   vines .
You   should   not   regard   the   capital   as   a   place   of   pleasure ,   And   allow   years   to   be   idle   away   as   you   dawdle   along .
The   general ' s   bow   freezes   and   stiffens   making   it   difficult   to   draw ,   His   protective   armour   gets   cold   yet   he   wears   it   still .
The   marshal   has   put   out   wine   to   bid   you   goodbye ,   With   Hun   lute ,   pipa   and   Jiang   flute   performances   to   entertain .
I   bid   you   farewell   at   the   east   gate   of   the   Town   of   Wheelbase ,   The   Sky   Mountain   pass   comes   under   heavy   snow   as   you   take   your   leave ;
Soon   I   lose   sight   of   you   as   you   follow   the   turns   into   the   mountains ,   All   there   is   on   the   snow   are   hoof   marks   where   the   horses   have   been .
You   came   from   home ,   A   bearer   of   home   news   you   should   be .
September ' s   winter   garment   pressing   sounds   hurried   leaves   yellow   and   trees   bare ,   For   ten   years   her   husband   had   been   at   the   Liaoyang   front   line   to   their   country   defend .
I   think   of   you   without   end ,   yet   an   endless   stretch   of   sky   lies   in   between ,   My   eyes   that   used   to   coquetry   portray ,   Now   they   are   like   springs   as   they   tears   weep .
For   thousands   of   miles   the   wind   blows   sending   autumn   geese   on   their   way ,   We   shall   drink   to   our   hearts '   content   here   on   a   tower   with   a   commanding   view .
On   board   a   boat   gazing   at   the   autumn   moon ,   I   think   of   General   Xie   who   here   by   chance   a   gifted   scholar ' s   worth   recognised .
A   light   breeze   wafted   in   the   fragrance   of   lotus ,   Off   bamboo   leaves   dew   drops   dripped   in   trickling   beats .
The   gurgling   waters   seems   to   know   where   goes   my   mind ,   Flying   in   dusk   over   me   are   birds   on   their   way   home .
The   mournful   sound   of   bugle   stirs   in   the   wee   hours ,   Above   the   Three   Gorges   celestial   bodies   of   the   Milky   Way   seems   to   tremble   and   shake .
How   hermits   in   the   woods ,   In   these   prospects   take   delight .
Where   is   the   venerable   one   among   fallen   leaves   all   around ?   On   my   way   here ,   clouds   have   been   building   in   the   cold ,   layer   after   layer .
The   scholar ,   Yu   Xin ' s   life   was   one   of   the   most   bleak   and   desolate ,   His   nostalgic   prose   touched   and   moved   people   of   Jiangling   causing   a   stir   in   those   days .
Appealed   to   my   senses   this   secluded   place   did ,   And   cleansed   me   of   troubling   sight   and   sound   of   the   world .
Satisfied   with   what   I   came   here   for ,   Why   indeed   must   I   wait   for   your   return ?
To   the   garden   centre   she   strolled   and   flowers   counted ,   A   dragonfly   the   scent   of   a   woman   followed   and   rested   on   her   hairpin   made   of   jade .
Gibbons   and   birds   of   this   garrison   still   prohibitions   of   Zhuge ' s   time   fear   and   respect ,   The   unpredictable   winds   and   clouds   are   still   guarding   the   cordon   he   defined .
Yet   in   vain   in   the   end   were   the   general ' s   lifelong   effort   spent   on   tactics ,   His   master   roped   himself   and   rode   out   in   a   carriage   to   surrender   and   his   throne   resign .
the   tune   carried   a   territorial   cadence   particular   to   the   capital .   I   asked   the   musician ,   it   turned   out   she   was   originally   a   performer   from   Changan ,   who   once   studied   pipa   under   master   musicians   Mu   and   Cao .
I   had   dismounted   from   my   horse   and   boarded   a   boat   were   my   guests ,   We   raised   our   drinks   to   toast   but   there   was   no   music   to   the   atmosphere   complement ;
Like   pelting   rain ,   the   bass   strings   give   a   deep   and   raucous   timbre ,   Like   a   whisper ,   the   treble   strings   spring   a   light   and   gentle   tone ;
At   the   end   of   a   tune ,   she   gathered   the   strings   in   the   heart   of   the   pipa   in   a   stroke ,   The   music   from   all   four   strings   end   on   a   silk   tear   of   a   note .
At   the   age   of   thirteen ,   I   became   learned   in   pipa ,   In   the   performers '   circle ,   I   was   the   one   with   top - notch   distinction .
Young   men   of   the   capital ' s   noble   hills   would   rush   before   me   to   riches   proffer ,   For   every   tune   I   played ,   I   received   countless   pieces   of   silk   and   satin .
Year   after   year   time   went   by   in   cheers   as   I   made   my   living ,   In   my   neglect ,   beautiful   scenes   of   the   changing   seasons   had   slid   by .
You   may   ask ,   aren ' t   there   folk   lores   and   local   flutes ?   Yet   harsh   and   hoarse   they   seem ,   hardly   music   to   ears .
In   the   twilight   of   Changan ,   the   Hun   cavalry   rove   through   raising   dust   all   over ,   Hoping   to   return   to   the   city ' s   south ,   I   look   to   the   newly - instated   court   in   the   north .
My   hometown   is   to   the   east ,   a   long   way   away ,   My   sleeves   aren ' t   enough   to   wipe   away   all   the   tears   in   my   clumsy   senile   state .
While   merchants   sleep   through   calm   waters   during   the   day ,   Boatmen   whisper   of   upcoming   undercurrents   at   night .
The   Lu   Mountains   divide   the   land   with   the   Archer   drawing   bow   overhead ,   The   landscape   expands   like   a   screen   of   nine   folds   embellished   with   clouds   in   the   sky ;
Her   dancing   shone   like   the   flare   when   Hou   Yi   shot   down   the   nine   suns ,   And   her   moves   were   as   swift   as   the   heavenly   gods   on   the   fly   in   dragon   chariots .
On   winding   paths   they   randomly   fall ,   Making   whirls   as   they   see   off   daylight ' s   afterglow .
Gone   with   spring   is   my   aspiring   heart ,   All   I   have   are   robe - drenching   teardrops .
Your   boat   sails   forth   carrying   those   Luoyang   bound ,   Faint   evening   toll   that   I   hear   must   be   from   the   bells   in   the   woods   of   the   Guangling   Plains .
Splendid   clouds   and   flowers   reminds   us   of   Lady   Yang ' s   beauty ,   Her   charm   is   ever - present   in   sill - crossing   spring   breezes   and   condensate   dews .
Gibbons   in   the   mountains   are   my   company   at   dawn   and   at   dusk ,   The   river   and   the   willows   are   there   with   me   to   brave   the   misty   wind .
I   am   very   much   like   Jia   Yi   in   exile   in   Changsha ,   How   many   years   still   before   my   homecoming ?
Letters   for   home   cannot   be   sent   for   now ,   Wild   geese   of   autumn   have   yet   again   southwards   migrated .
Maybe   the   Moon   Goddess   regrets   ever   having   stolen   the   elixir   of   life ,   As   night   after   night   she   must   over   azure   seas   hover   and   in   the   blue   resides .
Forever   in   a   comedown ,   I   travelled   the   country   accompanied   by   wine ,   Many   a   king   and   hero   indulged   in   feather - light   women   of   delicate   waist ,   as   so   did   I .
I ' ve   been   passing   nights   in   loneliness   till   candles   have   burnt   out   and   flames   extinguished ,   Now   that   pomegranate   are   flowering   red ,   yet   I   still   have   not   her   tidings .
Two   years   ago   an   army   was   sent   to   war   with   Yuezhi ,   At   the   base   of   their   town   the   whole   division   was   annihilated .
Village   children   came   to   greet   me   but   knew   me   not ,   They   cheerfully   took   me   for   a   visitor   and   enquired   where   I ' d   come   from .
A   capable   reign   gives   no   excuse   for   becoming   a   recluse ,   The   able   in   the   capital   assemble   to   allegiance   submit .
This   time   you ' ve   travelled   far   to   the   Golden   Gate   reach ,   Who   would   hold   contempt   of   your   attempt   so   sincere ?
I   bow   to   take   a   sip   of   wine ,   And   look   up   to   attend   to   compositions   of   poems   and   idylls   so   fine .
Do   not   be   like   the   Wuling   fisherman   who   discovered   utopia ,   Who   only   stayed   temporarily   for   some   sightseeing   of   the   peachy   haven .
Arriving   in   Hankou ,   against   the   setting   sun   across   the   river   fowls   flit ,   Fading   into   the   skies   are   the   autumn   colours   of   the   waters   of   Lake   Dongting .
There   was   Jia   Yi   who   wrote   to   the   Han   emperor   to   his   concerns   address ,   Yet   banished   to   Changsha   he   was ,   that   has   many   taking   pity   on   him   ever   since .
I   stopped   over   at   an   inn   without   a   companion ,   I   became   immersed   in   my   own   thoughts   as   I   of   silence   took   heed .
Oh ,   breezes   of   spring ,   I   know   you   not ,   Why   disturb   my   chamber   curtains ,   my   bedtime ?
Supported   by   a   cane   outside   my   timber   gate ,   I   face   the   wind   to   listen   as   evening   cicadas   sing .
Yet   her   natural   beauty   had   spelt   her   destiny   that   could   not   be   forsaken ,   Into   the   palace   she   did   go   and   by   the   Emperor \ ' s   side   she   was   received .
The   Li   Palace   soared   into   the   sky   among   clouds ,   From   there   heavenly   music   drifted   in   the   wind   far   and   wide .
She   pushed   aside   her   pillow   to   get   dressed ,   then   she   hesitated   and   paced ,   Surrounded   she   was   by   veils   of   golden   beads   and   silvery   mirror   panes .
Her   clothes   and   sleeves   were   fluttering   in   the   breeze ,   It   was   like   a   scene   from   the   Lady \ ' s   dance   of   the   Rainbow   Dress   and   Feather   Robe .
She   gazed   at   the   priest   in   silence   to   her   gratitude   to   the   Emperor   convey ,   Since   parting   they   could   not   each   other \ ' s   voice   hear   nor   visage   behold .
